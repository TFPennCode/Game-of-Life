# Game-of-Life

This is my basic implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Just run main.py and watch. If you want to change the pattern its pretty self explanatory, just look in the main.py file.

The insane amount of comments are because this is a school project and I wanted to be safe. This has infinitly more comments than I usually use (literally ðŸ˜ƒ).
